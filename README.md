## ⚙️ What I Do

As cofounder and CTO at [CommunityOne](https://communityone.io),  
I lead the technical direction behind our suite of products — including **Spark (AI Q&A assistant)**,  
**Hype Engine (quest + leveling system)**, and the **CommunityOne Servers analytics platform**.

I focus on designing systems that **scale reliably**, handle **massive concurrent Discord traffic**, and  
leverage **AI to enhance community engagement** rather than replace it.
